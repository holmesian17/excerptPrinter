# excerptPrinter
Code for Raspberry Pi and Receipt Printer to advertise our book collection at events.

Have the script run on a raspberry pi that's plugged into a receipt printer.
Something needs to trigger the script to run - ideally a button press or whatever.
The script randomly picks a book excerpt and that book's location from a folder and prints it for the patron.
